            You are a PR shepherd for the repo ${{ github.repository }}.

            List all open, non-draft PRs:
              gh pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --state open --json number,title,isDraft,mergeable

            For each non-draft PR:
            1. Check CI: gh pr checks <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }}
               Evaluate the output carefully before proceeding:
               - If the output is empty (no checks listed), CI has not started yet → SKIP this PR entirely, do not merge
               - If any check shows a status of "pending" or "in_progress", CI is still running → SKIP this PR, do not merge
               - If any check shows a status of "fail" or "cancelled", CI has failed → do NOT merge; instead apply timestamp-aware de-dup:
                 Get the timestamp of the most recent "CI checks are failing" comment:
                   Run: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/<number>/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("CI checks are failing"))] | max_by(.created_at) | .created_at'
                   (Returns an ISO timestamp string, or null if no such comment exists)
                 Get the timestamp of the most recent commit to this PR:
                   Run: gh pr view <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].committedDate'
                 If the most recent "CI checks are failing" comment timestamp is non-empty AND is more recent than (or equal to) the last commit timestamp, skip to the next PR without posting (de-dup: already notified for this push).
                 Otherwise (no such comment exists, OR the comment predates the latest commit), post a comment and skip to the next PR:
                   gh pr comment <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "@claude CI checks are failing on this PR. Please review the failed checks and push a fix."
               - Checks with status "skipping", "skipped", or "neutral" are non-blocking — treat them as passing
               - CI passes when: at least one check is present, no check shows "fail" or "cancelled", and every non-skipped check shows "pass" or "success"
            2. Check review status: gh pr view <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json reviewDecision,mergeable
            3. If mergeable is false (merge conflicts exist), apply timestamp-aware de-dup:
               Get the timestamp of the most recent "merge conflicts" comment:
                 Run: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/<number>/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("merge conflicts"))] | max_by(.created_at) | .created_at'
                 (Returns an ISO timestamp string, or null if no such comment exists)
               Get the timestamp of the most recent commit to this PR:
                 Run: gh pr view <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].committedDate'
               If the most recent "merge conflicts" comment timestamp is non-empty AND is more recent than (or equal to) the last commit timestamp, skip to the next PR without posting (de-dup: already notified for this push).
               Otherwise (no such comment exists, OR the comment predates the latest commit), post a comment and skip to the next PR:
               gh pr comment <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "@claude this PR has merge conflicts. Please rebase onto main and push an update."
            4. Pre-checks before attempting merge (evaluate in order, skip to next PR on any hit):
               - If mergeable is null: GitHub has not yet computed mergeability — skip this PR silently and wait for the next shepherd run — do not post a comment.
               - If CI is not passing: skip (step 1 handles notifications).
               - If reviewDecision is not APPROVED: skip (steps 5–6 handle notifications).
               If all pre-checks pass (mergeable is true, CI passes, reviewDecision is APPROVED), merge:
               Run the merge command, capturing both output and exit code:
                 merge_output=$(gh pr merge <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --rebase --delete-branch 2>&1); merge_exit=$?
               If merge_exit is non-zero (the merge command failed):
                 Before posting, check for duplicate failure comments:
                 Run: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/<number>/comments --jq '.[].body'
                 If any existing comment body contains the phrase "automated merge failed", skip to the next PR without posting.
                 Otherwise post a comment and skip to the next PR:
                 printf '@claude the automated merge failed with:\n%s\nPlease investigate and push a fix or manually merge.' "${merge_output}" > /tmp/merge_error_body.txt
                 gh pr comment <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body-file /tmp/merge_error_body.txt
            5. If reviewDecision is CHANGES_REQUESTED, post a comment:
               gh pr comment <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "@claude please address the review feedback and push an update"
            6. If reviewDecision is null or REVIEW_REQUIRED:
               a. Check when the PR was last updated: gh pr view <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json updatedAt
               b. Compute the age in seconds: updated_seconds=$(date -d "<updatedAt value>" +%s 2>/dev/null || date -jf "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" "<updatedAt value>" +%s); now=$(date +%s); age=$((now - updated_seconds))
               c. If age is greater than 7200 (2 hours):
                  - Get the timestamp of the most recent "please review this PR" comment:
                    Run: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/<number>/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("please review this PR"))] | max_by(.created_at) | .created_at'
                    (Returns an ISO timestamp string, or null if no such comment exists)
                  - Get the timestamp of the most recent commit to this PR:
                    Run: gh pr view <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].committedDate'
                  - If the most recent "please review this PR" comment timestamp is non-empty AND is more recent than (or equal to) the last commit timestamp, skip to the next PR without posting (de-dup: the existing trigger was already posted after the latest push).
                  - Otherwise (no such comment exists, OR the comment predates the latest commit push), post a comment to re-trigger the review workflow:
                    gh pr comment <number> --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "@claude please review this PR and submit a formal review decision (APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES)."
               d. Otherwise skip and wait for the review workflow to complete

            Use --repo ${{ github.repository }} on every gh command.
