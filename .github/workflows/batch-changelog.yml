            Batch-update CHANGELOG.md for all open "Changelog skipped" issues.

            DRY_RUN=${{ github.event.inputs.dry_run }}

            Steps:

            1. Find all open issues matching the "Changelog skipped for" pattern:
                 gh issue list --state open --search "Changelog skipped for" --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number)|\(.title)"'

               For each result, extract the tag name from the issue title. The title format is:
                 "Changelog skipped for <tag_name>: <reason>"
               Parse the tag by taking the token immediately after "Changelog skipped for " and
               before the first colon. For example, from the title
               "Changelog skipped for v1.0.2: failed to push changelog to main", extract "v1.0.2".

               Store the collected issue numbers (space-separated) in ISSUE_NUMBERS and the
               corresponding tag names in TAGS for use in later steps.

            2. If no matching issues are found, print "No open Changelog-skipped issues found." and stop.

            3. If DRY_RUN is "true", print the list of issue numbers and tag names that would be
               processed, then stop without making any changes.

            4. Read the current CHANGELOG.md (treat it as empty if it does not exist).

            5. For each tag collected in step 1:
               a. Check if CHANGELOG.md already has a section header for this tag
                  (look for a line starting with "## <tag>"). If found, the entry already
                  exists — skip generating a new entry but still proceed to step 7 to close
                  the issue.
               b. Fetch the release details:
                    gh release view <tag> --json tagName,body,publishedAt
                  If the release does not exist or the command fails, print a warning and skip
                  this tag entirely (do not close its issue).
               c. Build the new changelog entry in this exact format:
                    ## <tag> — YYYY-MM-DD
                    <release body text>
                  Use the release's publishedAt field for the date; format it as YYYY-MM-DD.

            6. Prepend all new entries to CHANGELOG.md, with a blank line between each entry
               and between the new entries and any existing content. Write the updated file.

               Configure git identity, create a changelog branch, commit, push, and open a PR
               with auto-merge enabled. Direct pushes to main are blocked by branch protection
               rules, so this follows the same pattern as auto-tag.yml:
                 git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
                 git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
                 CHANGELOG_BRANCH="changelog/batch-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
                 git checkout -b "$CHANGELOG_BRANCH"
                 git add CHANGELOG.md
                 git commit -m "chore: batch update changelog for all skipped releases"
                 git push origin "$CHANGELOG_BRANCH"
                 CLOSES_LINES=$(for num in $ISSUE_NUMBERS; do echo "Closes #$num"; done)
                 PR_BODY=$(printf "Automated batch changelog update. Direct pushes to main are blocked by branch protection rules.\n\n%s" "$CLOSES_LINES")
                 PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
                   --repo ${{ github.repository }} \
                   --title "chore: batch update changelog for all skipped releases" \
                   --body "$PR_BODY" \
                   --base main \
                   --head "$CHANGELOG_BRANCH")
                 PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$PR_URL" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
                 gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" --repo ${{ github.repository }} --squash --auto --delete-branch
                 gh label create claude-task --description 'Assigned to Claude for implementation' --color 7057ff 2>/dev/null || true
                 gh issue edit "$PR_NUMBER" --repo ${{ github.repository }} --add-label "claude-task"

            7. Do NOT manually close the issues when a PR was created. The "Closes #<N>" entries
               in the PR body (added in step 6) will cause GitHub to auto-close them when the PR
               merges. If the PR is closed without merging, the issues remain open for the
               scanner to retry.

               Exception — if no new entries were needed (all tags already had entries in
               CHANGELOG.md), no PR is created, so close each matching issue manually and skip
               the git commit step:
                 gh issue close <number> --comment "Resolved: changelog entry already exists in CHANGELOG.md."
