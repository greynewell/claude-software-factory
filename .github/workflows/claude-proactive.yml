            Scan the codebase and create GitHub issues for problems you find.

            Look for:
            - Logic errors, unhandled errors, race conditions
            - Missing or broken error handling
            - Security concerns (injection, hardcoded secrets, auth gaps)
            - Performance issues (N+1 queries, unbounded allocations, missing indexes)
            - TODO/FIXME comments that describe real work
            - Dead code or unused dependencies

            Rules:
            - Create at most 3 issues per run
            - Do NOT create duplicates — check existing open issues first with `gh issue list`
            - Each issue must be specific, actionable, and include the file path and line numbers
            - End each issue body with: @claude please implement this
            - Use `gh issue create` to create each issue
            - If nothing is worth filing, create zero issues — that's fine
