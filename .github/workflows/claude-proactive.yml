            You are the Claude Software Factory scanning itself for improvements. This repo IS
            the factory — its workflows are the product. Improving them is the primary goal.

            Check existing open issues first to avoid duplicates:
              gh issue list --state open --limit 100

            Before filing each issue, also run a targeted keyword search to catch duplicates
            even when the open issue count exceeds the list limit:
              gh issue list --state open --search "keyword from proposed title" --limit 10
            Only file an issue if neither check returns a matching open issue.

            Scan in two passes:

            **Pass 1 — Factory self-improvement** (highest priority):
            Read every file in .github/workflows/ and CLAUDE.md. Look for:
            - Workflow prompts that are ambiguous, incomplete, or could be sharper
            - Missing error handling or edge cases (shepherd merging too eagerly, etc.)
            - New workflows that would close gaps in the loop (dependency updates, changelog,
              security scanning, performance regression, notification hooks, etc.)
            - Ways to make the self-loop tighter (concurrency, retry logic, bot triggers)
            - CLAUDE.md instructions that are unclear or missing

            Also check the real-world health of the factory loop. First, check shepherd health:
              gh run list --workflow=claude-pr-shepherd.yml --limit 5 --json conclusion,startedAt
            If the command returns an empty array (no results), the shepherd has no run history —
            treat it as healthy and proceed directly to per-PR stuck logic below.
            If every one of the 5 most recent shepherd runs has conclusion "failure" or "cancelled"
            (i.e. no successful run exists), the shepherd itself is broken. In that case:
            - Before filing, check for an existing shepherd health issue:
                gh issue list --state open --search "shepherd" --limit 10
              Only file ONE issue if no matching open issue already exists.
            - File ONE issue about shepherd health (e.g. "claude-pr-shepherd.yml: all recent runs
              failing — investigate broken shepherd") instead of per-PR stuck issues.
            - Do NOT file per-PR stuck issues when the shepherd is globally broken; those would
              only add noise while the root cause is the broken shepherd.
            If at least one recent shepherd run succeeded, the shepherd is healthy. In that case,
            check stuck PRs by running:
              gh pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --state open --json number,title,createdAt,updatedAt,reviewDecision
            Flag and file an issue for each of the following (if no open issue already covers it):
            - Any PR that has been open > 2 days without a review decision (scanner is blind or
              the review workflow is broken)
            - Any PR whose reviewDecision is APPROVED but has not been merged AND whose updatedAt
              is more than 2 hours ago (7200 seconds before current time); skip recently-approved
              PRs to avoid false positives while the shepherd completes its next cycle

            **Pass 2 — General codebase issues**:
            - Logic errors, race conditions, unhandled exceptions
            - Security vulnerabilities or hardcoded secrets
            - TODO/FIXME comments representing real work
            - Dead code or unused files

            For each finding, file an issue:
              gh issue create --title "..." --body "...specific file, current behavior, desired behavior...\n\n@claude please implement this"

            File at most 3 issues per run. Prioritize factory self-improvement over general bugs.
            Zero issues is fine if nothing concrete warrants attention.
