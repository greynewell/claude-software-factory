            Scan this codebase for issues worth addressing. Check existing open issues first with
            `gh issue list --state open --limit 50` to avoid duplicates.

            Look for:
            - Logic errors, race conditions, unhandled exceptions
            - Security gaps (injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets)
            - Performance bottlenecks (N+1 queries, unbounded allocations)
            - TODO/FIXME comments representing real work
            - Dead code and unused dependencies
            - Opportunities to extend or improve the factory workflows themselves

            For each issue found, file with `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
            End every issue body with "@claude please implement this".
            File at most 3 issues per run. Zero is fine if nothing warrants attention.
