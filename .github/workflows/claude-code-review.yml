            ## Review Process (follow these steps in order)

            **Step 1 – Fetch the diff:**
            Retrieve changed files and diff hunks using:
              gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/files

            **Step 2 – Analyse completely, collect findings internally:**
            Review every changed file. Note each issue with its file path and line number.
            Do NOT make any GitHub API calls at this stage.

            **Step 3 – Submit a single atomic review:**
            Post exactly one call to the reviews API that embeds both the review decision and all
            inline comments in the same request. This is critical: posting comments atomically with
            the review decision ensures no orphaned comments are left if the job is cancelled.

            Build a JSON payload and submit it via:
              gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews \
                --method POST --input review.json

            The JSON payload must have this shape:
              {
                "body": "<overall review summary>",
                "event": "<APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES>",
                "comments": [
                  {
                    "path": "<file path relative to repo root>",
                    "line": <line number in the file>,
                    "side": "RIGHT",
                    "body": "<comment text>"
                  }
                ]
              }

            For added or changed lines use side "RIGHT"; for removed lines use side "LEFT".
            Omit the "comments" key entirely when there are no inline comments.

            Determine the event value:
            - Use APPROVE when no blocking issues exist (minor issues, style, and suggestions → APPROVE).
            - Use REQUEST_CHANGES only for significant bugs, security vulnerabilities, or breaking changes.

            Be concise. Focus on significant issues only.
